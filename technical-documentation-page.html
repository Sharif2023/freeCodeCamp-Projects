                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction: The Fall of an Authoritarian Leader</h2>
                <p>
                    In a historic and turbulent period, the people of Bangladesh succeeded in deposing Sheikh Hasina, 
                    a leader who wielded power with an increasingly authoritarian grip. 
                    The large protests that began in mid-July 2024 resulted in Hasina's resignation on August 5, 
                    marking the end of her lengthy and contentious administration. 
                    Initially sparked by dissatisfaction with an unfair quota system, 
                    the protests swiftly evolved into a nationwide movement against Hasina's dictatorial rule. 
                    Citizens from all walks of life, fed up with corruption, economic mismanagement, 
                    and human rights violations, took to the streets in unprecedented unity. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ironically, the government's violent efforts to crush the protests only strengthened the people's resolve.

                <p>
                    The movement's roots lay in public outrage over an unjust quota system, 
                    which was seen as emblematic of broader inequality and corruption 
                    under Sheikh Hasina's rule. What began as a focused demand for 
                    reform quickly escalated into a mass uprising. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Widespread grievances about government mismanagement, 
                    including allegations of embezzlement and abuses of power, 
                    resonated deeply with a frustrated population. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The injustice of the system, combined with years of authoritarian policies, 
                    catalyzed an unprecedented wave of protests, uniting diverse sections of society.

                <p>
                    Protests became a symbol of inclusion, attracting students, activists, and everyday citizens. 
                    The rallying cry for democracy, justice, and an end to authoritarianism reverberated throughout the country. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Sheikh Hasina's administration had long been criticized for suppressing dissent, censoring the media, 
                    and deploying security forces to silence criticism. 
                    Accusations of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings had created a climate of fear. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet, the protests revealed the unyielding spirit of the Bangladeshi people, 
                    who were determined to reclaim their rights.

                <p>
                    Sheikh Hasina's regime will be remembered for its harsh measures 
                    against opposition voices and the erosion of democratic norms. 
                    The administration's alleged involvement in human rights violations and 
                    its focus on consolidating power overshadowed any developmental achievements. 
                    The violent crackdown on protesters served as a grim reminder of the systemic 
                    repression that had plagued the country for years. Ultimately, the regime's 
                    inability to address public grievances or adapt to changing sentiments led to its downfall.

                    By early August 2024, the protests had reached a critical point. Demonstrators flooded the streets 
                    of Dhaka and other major cities, demanding Hasina's immediate resignation. 
                    Losing the support of key military and political allies, Hasina had no choice but to step down. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her resignation marked a victory for the people and delivered a clear message: dictatorship has 
                    no place in Bangladesh. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This moment cemented the power of collective action and the resilience of the Bangladeshi spirit.

                    Bangladesh has a rich history of student-led movements shaping its political landscape. 
                    From the Language Movement of 1952 to the Liberation War of 1971, students have often 
                    been at the forefront of change. The 2024 protests were no exception. Initially 
                    focused on quota reforms, they quickly evolved into a larger rebellion against 
                    authoritarian rule. The bravery and resolve of the youth served as a powerful reminder 
                    of their ability to challenge entrenched regimes and demand justice.

                <p>
                    The term "second independence" has been widely used to describe the recent events in Bangladesh. 
                    Much like the liberation struggle of 1971, the 2024 uprising symbolized a fight for 
                    freedom—this time from domestic tyranny rather than foreign oppression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The successful overthrow of Sheikh Hasina's government has rekindled hopes for a democratic future. 
                    It highlights the sovereignty of the people and their unwavering commitment to preserving their rights and freedoms.

                <p>
                    As of August 8, 2024, an interim government has been formed, 
                    with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser. 
                    The 16-member advisory council includes distinguished figures such as Saleh Uddin Ahmed, 
                    Syeda Rizwana Hasan, and others, reflecting a commitment to diversity and transparency. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interim administration's primary goal is to stabilize the nation, rebuild public trust, 
                    and guide the country toward free and fair elections. This transitional period is critical 
                    for ensuring a sustainable democratic future.

                    The fall of Sheikh Hasina presents both opportunities and challenges. 
                    Economic recovery, restoring democratic institutions, and addressing 
                    human rights violations are urgent priorities. The interim government must ensure 
                    accountability for past abuses while laying the groundwork for transparent governance. 
                    Engaging the youth and civil society in rebuilding efforts will be crucial.

                    The international community's support, coupled with the resilience of the Bangladeshi people,
